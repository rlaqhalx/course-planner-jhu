Course Planner with RESTful API and React app

Deployed version: https://rlaqhalx.github.io/course-planner-jhu/

## Description

<br>It is an application that allows a user to search the computer science courses catalog and organize them into three categories: </br>
<br> - Taken, Enrolled, Interested 

<br> This application uses my school id as authorization key so this app is based on courses I have taken, enrolled, and interested. </br>
<br> If you would like to use this planner for your id, you can go to src/api/index.js and change the authorization to your jhu id. </br>
<br> Id that has not been used by anyone using this api would have a empty list of courses for taken, enrolled, and interested, </br>
<br> In keeping with the client-server architecture, the application has a back-end and front-end component. </br>
<br> The back-end exposes a RESTful API and the front-end is built using React. </br>
<br> The back-end of this application is deployed at https://courses-api-hw4.herokuapp.com </br>
